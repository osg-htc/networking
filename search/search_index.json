This dependency upon the network means that issues in our networks can significantly impact the behavior of all the various cyber-infrastructure components that rely upon it. Compounding the problem is that networks, by their nature, are distributed and typically involve many different \"owners\" and administrators. When a problem arises somewhere along a network path, it can be very difficult to identify and localize.</p> <p>This was the context for the formation of the perfSONAR collaboration. This collaboration is focused on developing and deploying the <code>perfSONAR</code> software suite in support of network monitoring across the global set of research and education (R&amp;E) networks. The Open Science Grid (OSG) has chosen to base the core of its network monitoring framework on <code>perfSONAR</code> because of both the capabilities of the toolkit for measuring our networks and its global acceptance as the defacto network monitoring infrastructure of first choice.</p> <p>The https://www.perfsonar.net/about/what-is-perfsonar/ provides a succinct summary: perfSONAR is a network measurement toolkit designed to provide federated coverage of paths, and help to establish end-to-end usage expectations. There are 1000s of perfSONAR instances deployed world wide, many of which are available for open testing of key measures of network performance. This global infrastructure helps to identify and isolate problems as they happen, making the role of supporting network users easier for engineering teams, and increasing productivity when utilizing network resources.</p> <p>How can OSG/WLCG members and collaborators understand, maintain and effectively utilize the networks that form the basis of their distributed collaborations?</p> <p>Our answer starts by providing visibility into our networks by the deployment of <code>perfSONAR</code>. perfSONAR allows us to regularly and consistently measure a set of network metrics that we can use to understand how our networks are operating. When problems arise, the data, along with access to the <code>perfSONAR</code> tools, can be used to diagnose and localize problems. The presence of perfSONAR toolkit deployments across our sites and networks makes identifying and fixing network problems feasible.</p> <p>We strongly recommend that all OSG (and WLCG) sites deploy <code>perfSONAR</code> toolkit instances as described in our installation guide. Before installing you should consult the requirements along with the guidance on deployment models.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Installing perfSONAR not only benefits users at a site but will enable network engineers and OSG staff to much more effectively support those sites if network issues are suspected.</p> <p>All OSG and WLCG sites should deploy two <code>perfSONAR</code> instances: one to measure latency/packet loss and one to measure bandwidth. It is possible to install both versions on a single host with at least two NICs by following the instructions at multiple NIC guidance page.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>It is very important that the perfSONAR instances be located in the same subnet as the primary storage for the site.  This is to ensure that we are measuring as much of the network path involved with data transfer as possible.</p> <p>The WLCG Network Throughput Working Group is responsible for monitoring the WLCG/OSG instances and for defining and maintaining the mesh-configurations that we use to control perfSONAR testing. Please contact us if you have questions or suggestions related to perfSONAR testing amongst WLCG sites.</p> <p>For anyone maintaining/using perfSONAR we suggest to join either/both of the following mailing lists:</p> <ul> <li>User's Mailing List The perfSONAR project maintains a mailing list for communication on matters of installation, configuration, bug reports, or general performance discussions: https://lists.internet2.edu/sympa/subscribe/perfsonar-user</li> <li>Announcement Mailing List The perfSONAR project also maintains a low volume mailing list used for announcements related to software updates and vulnerabilities: https://lists.internet2.edu/sympa/subscribe/perfsonar-announce</li> </ul>"},{"location":"perfsonar-in-osg/#changes-for-perfsonar-50","title":"Changes for perfSONAR 5.0","text":"<p>The first release of perfSONAR 5.0.0 was available on April 17, 2023, followed by a version supporting EL8/EL9 on June 21, 2023 (version 5.0.3).

Often it is the case that scientific data is gathered via a well defined process, information is digitized, stored, transmitted, and processed by members of large and distributed collaborations.  The Open Science Grid advances science through the concept of distributed computing \u2013 the process for sharing resources through a unified software framework focused on the common tasks of data movement, processing, and analysis.</p> <p>Networks are an integral part of the distributed computing process.  Similar to the computational and storage resources, it is crucial that all networking components, on the complete end-to-end path, are functional and free of physical and logical flaws.  A rich set of measurement and monitoring tools exists to provide network operations staff and end users a window into the functionality of networks, despite the fact that these actors do not have direct control over the complete path their data may travel.</p> <p>This document discusses common measurement and monitoring tools available to the OSG community, and strategies to deploy, use, and interpret the results they produce.  The end goal is to give end users more insight into network behavior, and assist local and remote networking staffs as they correct damaging performance problems that will impact the scientific process.</p>"},{"location":"network-troubleshooting/osg-debugging-document/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>The process of science is often complicated when viewed as a complete system.  At the core of any project, there is a mechanism to observe or simulate some system, and produce meaningful results that will be interpreted and scrutinized between experimentation runs.   The machinery that surrounds this process can be as benign as simple cameras, or as complex as the Large Hadron Collider and its associated experiments.  Other common components include ways to digitize, store, process, and share the end result of experimentation \u2013 often done using computational systems.</p> <p>Computation falls into 3 broad classifications, all of which are required to implement the paradigm of scientific computing:</p> <ul> <li>Storage \u2013 Readable and writable physical medium used for temporary or long term residency of gathered data.</li> <li>Processing \u2013 Specially designed hardware and software that iterates over collected data sets looking for pre-defined triggers and results.</li> <li>Networking \u2013 Interconnecting hardware and software used to facilitate communication between storage and processing components both on a local, and fully distributed basis.</li> </ul> <p>When fully realized, even a small facility can contribute a great amount of resources to the overall goal of scientific advancement.  In practice it may be the case that a lab consisting of a single researcher can pull data sets from a centralized location, perform carefully selected segments of an entire set of analysis that is required, and return any relevant results as they are discovered.  When used in an inductive fashion, one can imagine the overall throughout that a VO such as the LHC project is able to attain through 100s of distributed facilities and 1000s of collaborating researchers.</p> <p>Complexity is present as we travel down the individual technology items in the above scenario.  Often it is the case that ideal performance is hard to attain due to the intertwined nature of the mechanisms involved.  For example, data must be written and read from physical medium.  Often this step is slower due to the mechanical nature of the process, and struggles to keep up with faster technologies such as processing or transmission on network infrastructure.  Equally, it may be the case that a flaw in the network infrastructure, such as a failing component, can introduce data loss that must be compensated for through retransmission.  Retransmission implies additional work for storage and processing components that must waste resources to overcome a fixable, but often unnoticed, problem.</p> <p>Network performance monitoring is a relatively unseen, but still extremely necessary, practice.  This statement is true due to the nature of network use through application software and communication protocols.  Application developers wish to unburden the user with details about \"how\" data may be moved between facilities.  Care is taken to design applications in such a way that the user is simply presented with options related to a source and destination only, and little or no insight into the path taken or the current conditions that may be present.  The aforementioned situation where a failing component institutes data loss results in only one symptom to the end user: lower than expected throughput.  Many users may not notice, or have become complacent, with low performance situations.  Some may write this off as \"the network is slow\", or perhaps will not notice at all due to experiences with home connections that are often 2 orders of magnitude slower than what is possible in a typical academic environment.</p> <p>Software exists to monitor network performance in many different ways.  For example it is possible take a measure of network throughput, and simulate the behavior of a file transfer application.  It is also possible to observe network stability (e.g. jitter) over time to simulate video or audio transmission.  These basic observations are powerful when used both in a local environment, as well as on an end-to-end basis.  In either case, software must be deployed and available to the community on points of interest: specifically on the local and shared network infrastructure distributed around the world.  perfSONAR is a software framework that simplifies network debugging activities by making it easier to deploy measurement tools, and facilities the sharing of results.  It is currently deployed on many communal networking resources in the R&amp;E community, including backbones, regional networks, campuses, and individual laboratories.</p> <p>Once perfSONAR is deployed, it becomes possible to troubleshoot situations that result in low throughout for the end user in a straightforward manner.  It is important to note that when something like this occurs, it is not the sole responsibility of the end user to debug and solve a networking problem; rather it is their duty to report the problem and provide as much information as possible to local or remote network staffs so they may learn about the issue, and interpret the results so as to lead to quick and efficient problem resolution.  Locating this staff may be challenging, but many organizations maintain a dedicated Network Operations Center (NOC) whose staff are ready to accept trouble reports and act in an appropriate manner.

Protocols are constructed in a \"layered\" fashion, and are designed to handle certain aspects of the overall communication plan.  For instance a protocol may be used to communicate between two network devices, and may involve the use of different patterns of electrical or optical signal.  On top of this basic system of signals we may construct a different protocol that is focused on communication between end hosts, and is able to break up the notion of a user's files into small chunks so they can be sent reliably end-to-end.</p> <p>Protocols evolve with the underlying technology, and often can be tuned to specific use cases.  One such protocol, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), is widely used in applications that many users are familiar with such as web browsing, mail transfer, and file exchange.  Early incarnations of TCP were designed for the networks of the 1980s; slower, less reliable, constructions than what is present in the networks of the 2010s.  As such TCP must be instructed, via configuration on a host or network devices operating environment,  that it should behave in a different and more efficient manner.</p> <p>With the protocol in place, we can now begin to discuss applications that are able to use the network to communicate in an automated fashion.</p>"},{"location":"network-troubleshooting/osg-debugging-document/#applications","title":"Applications","text":"<p>Applications are specific use cases, programmed as software, and made available to end users via a host's operating environment.

Scientific applications normally focus on performing a single task (e.g. end-to-end data movement, visualization, data transformation, data analysis) on either a local or distributed basis.</p> <p>In the case of distribution, it becomes necessary to interact with the underlying network through the use of a protocol.  File transfer is a specialized application that takes is interested in either sending a local file to a remote location, or retrieving remote data to bring locally.  In either case the application must broker with a protocol, such as TCP, that is available on both ends of the transfer.  Through a series of API calls information is segmented into transmission chunks and sent reliably though the communication medium.  Most of this is handled transparently from the user's perspective, and as such they are not given much in the way of feedback beyond a pass or failure, and some notion of how long it took.</p> <p>Understanding more about the network can be enlightening exercise for users who are unaware of the complexity and span of components that are required for operation.

If it doesn't, please considering following the host tuning steps discussed in Section 5.1</li> <li>NDT will give the first indication of network problems as well, and may indicate the presence of packet loss, link bottlenecks, or congestion.  Since NDT is based on heuristics these results can turn out to be false positives, but are often worthy of following up on.  In the event of congestion, ask local networking staff to see if there are any heavily utilized links.  If packet loss is an issue, ask to see if any interface errors or discards are present.</li> <li>BWCTL, when used in TCP mode, is only useful at nothing high or low throughput.

This ensures that the test results are not impacted by the other tests. Otherwise it is much more difficult to interpret test results, which may vary due to host effects rather then network effects. Taking this into account it means that perfSONAR measurement tools are much more accurate running on a dedicated hardware and while it may be useful to run them on other hosts such as Data Transfer Nodes the current recommendation is to have specific measurement machine. In addition, as bandwidth testing could impact latency testing, we recommend to deploy two different nodes, each focused on specific set of tests. The following deployment options are currently available:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Bare metal - preffered option in one of two possible configurations:</p> <p><code>* Two bare metal servers, one for latency node, one for bandwidth node * One bare metal server running both latency and bandwidth node together provided that there are two NICs available, please refer to [dual NIC](#multiple-nic-network-interface-card-guidance) section for more details on this.</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Virtual Machine - if bare metal is not available then it is also possible to run perfSONAR on a VM, however there are a set of additional requirements to fulfill:</p> <p><code>* Full-node VM is strongly preferred, having 2 VMs (latency/bandwidth node) on a single bare metal. Mixing perfSONAR VM(s) with others might have an impact on the measurements and is therefore not recommended. * VM needs to be configured to have SR-IOV to NIC(s) as well as pinned CPUs to ensure bandwidth tests are not impacted (by hypervisor switching CPUs during the test) * Succesfull full speed local bandwidth test is highly recommended prior to putting the VM into production</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Container - perfSONAR has supported containers from version 4.1 (Q1 2018) and is documented at https://docs.perfsonar.net/install_docker.html but is not typically used in the same way as a full toolkit installation.</p> <p>``` * Docker perfSONAR test instance can however still be used by sites that run multiple perfSONAR instances on site for their internal testing as this deployment model allows to flexibly deploy a testpoint which can send results to a local measurement archive running on the perfSONAR toolkit node.</p> <p>```</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"perfsonar/deployment-models/#perfsonar-toolkit-vs-testpoint","title":"perfSONAR Toolkit vs Testpoint","text":"<p>The perfSONAR team has documented the types of installations supported at https://docs.perfsonar.net/install_options.html.

Bandwidth node measures available (or peak) throughput with low test frequency and will thus require NIC with high capacity (1/10/40/100G are supported) as well as enough memory and CPU to support high bandwidth testing. Our recommendation is to match bandwidth node NIC speed with the one installed on the storage nodes as this would provide us with the best match when there are issues to investigate. In case you'd like to deploy high speed (100G) bandwidth node, please consult ESNet tuning guide and 100G tuning presentation. Latency node on the other hand runs low bandwidth, but high frequency tests, sending a continuous stream of packets to measure delay and corresponding packet loss, packet reordering, etc. This means that while it doesn't require high capacity NIC, 1G is usually sufficient, it can impose significant load on the IO to disk as well as CPU as many tests run in parallel and need to continuously store its results into local measurement archive. The minimum hardware requirements to run perfSONAR toolkit are documented here. For WLCG/OSG deployment and taking into account the amount of testing that we perform, we recommend at least the following for perfSONAR 5.0+:</p> <ul> <li>NIC for bandwidth node matching the capacity of the site storage nodes(10/25/40/100G), 1G NIC for latency node (for higher NIC capacities, 40/100G, please check ESNet tuning guide)</li> <li>High clock speede CPU (3.0 Ghz+), fwere cores OK, with at least 32GB+ of RAM (8GB+ if using a Testpoint install)</li> <li>NVMe or SSD disk (128GB should be sufficient) if using full Toolkit install with Opensearch.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"perfsonar/deployment-models/#multiple-nic-network-interface-card-guidance","title":"Multiple NIC (Network Interface Card) Guidance","text":"<p>Many sites would prefer not to have to deploy two servers for cost, space and power reasons.

Please indicate if you have preferences for which meshes your node should be included in (USATLAS, USCMS, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, Alice, BelleII, etc.). You could also add any additional local tests  via web interface (see Configuring regular tests for details). Please check which tests are auto-added via central meshes before adding any custom tests to avoid duplication.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>```</p> <p>Until your host is added (on https://psconfig.opensciencegrid.org ) to one or more meshes by a mesh-config administrator, the automesh configuration above won't be returning any tests (See registration information above).</p> <pre><code>```\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>We strongly recommend configuring perfSONAR in dual-stack mode (both IPv4 and IPv6). In case your site has IPv6 support, the only necessary step is to get both A and AAAA records for your perfSONAR DNS names (as well as ensuring the reverse DNS is in place).</li> <li>Adding communities is optional, but if you do, we recommend putting in WLCG as well as your VO: <code>ATLAS</code>, <code>CMS</code>, etc. This just helps others from the community lookup your instances in the public lookup service. As noted in the documentation you can select from already registered communities as appropriate.</li> <li>Please check that both local and campus firewall has the necessary port openings.

Allowing access to port 443 is required because it's now used as a controller port for scheduling tests (via pScheduler). If sites are unable to reach your instance on port 443, tests may not run and results may not be available. Starting from perfSONAR 4.0, HTTPS/443 is now by default configured on all perfSONAR instances, i.e. local iptables as well as httpd configuration comes out of the box and requires no extra steps, therefore opening is only needed if you have central/campus firewall.</p> <pre><code>```\n</code></pre> <p>For sites that are concerned about having port 443 open, there is a possiblity to get a list of hosts to/from which the tests will be initiated.
