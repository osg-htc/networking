# OSG Network Services

Open Science Grid is providing a number of network-related services to support its members and collaborators in monitoring, understanding, measuring, diagnosing and managing the networks
used to support their work.

Here we will provide an overview of the OSG network services and where to find more information.

Much of the work to create effective analytics is being done in the NSF funded [SAND project](http://sand-ci.org/) which is exploring technologies and methodologies to analyze, summarize and visualize the various networking metrics we have available in the OSG networking data pipeline. As some of these tools and dashboards become production ready, we will add them to this documentation.
