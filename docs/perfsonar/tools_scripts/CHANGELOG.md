## [1.1.3] - 2025-12-06

### Fixed

* Corrected IOMMU audit messaging to suggest `grubby` for BLS systems (EL9+) and `grub2-mkconfig`/`update-grub` for legacy systems. Also bumped `fasterdata-tuning.sh` to v1.1.3 and updated site copy + checksums.

### Notes

* This is a minor documentation & diagnostic improvement; no new behavioral changes beyond clearer messaging and version bump.
