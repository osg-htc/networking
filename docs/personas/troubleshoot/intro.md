# Troubleshooter — Overview


This area contains short triage checklists, playbooks, and example commands to gather the right information fast. Start
with `triage-checklist-v2.md` to collect the host and network facts, then follow a specific playbook for the observed
symptom.

Key items:

- `triage-checklist-v2.md` — minimal data collection and verification steps

- `playbooks/` — scenario-based runbooks (e.g., multi-NIC routing, firewall blocks, container issues)
