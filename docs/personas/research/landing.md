# Research — Architecture & Rationale

This area is for readers who want to understand system architecture, data pipelines, and development notes. See `architecture.md` and `data-pipeline.md` for diagrams and ingestion details.

Key pages:

- `architecture.md` — component diagrams and responsibilities
- `data-pipeline.md` — how measurements are ingested, stored, and processed
- `tools/` — scripts, notebooks, and data access helpers

If you want to contribute architecture notes or diagrams, add a short summary and attach a PNG/SVG in `docs/personas/research/assets/` and link it from the relevant page.
