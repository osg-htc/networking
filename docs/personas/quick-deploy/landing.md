# Quick Deploy — perfSONAR Testpoint

This landing page links to minimal, tested instructions and automation to get a perfSONAR testpoint running quickly.

- Quickstart (minimal): `quickstart-perfsonar-testpoint-v2.md`
- Automated setups and optional features: `automated-setup/README.md`

If you need a working testpoint in a single admin session, follow the quickstart; if you plan repeated deploys, use the automation examples.
