# Quick Deploy — Overview

This folder contains short, tested procedures to get a working service online quickly. Each quickstart focuses on the
minimum steps required for a working deployment, along with a short verification checklist and links to optional
hardening or automation pages.

Start here if you need a working service in a single admin session. For perfSONAR testpoints the canonical quickstart is
`quickstart-perfsonar-testpoint-v2.md` (recommended).

What you will find:

- Minimal quickstarts (install + verify)

- Brief verification steps and smoke tests

- Links to automation and optional hardening (firewall, selinux, nftables)

If you are doing repeat deployments, use the automated setup examples in `automated-setup/` instead of the manual
quickstarts.
