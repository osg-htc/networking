%TOC%

%STARTINCLUDE%
For those not familiar with =perfSONAR=, we provide a quick overview of what it is and why we recommend its deployment at OSG and WLCG sites.

---+++ The Challenge 
Distributed scientific computing relies upon networks to interconnect resources and make them usable for scientific workflows.  This dependency upon the network means that issues in our networks can significantly impact the behavior of all the various cyber-infrastructure components that rely upon it.  Compounding the problem is that networks, by their nature, are distributed and typically involve many different "owners" and administrators.  When a problem arises somewhere along a network path, it can be very difficult to identify and localize.    

This was the context for the formation of the perfSONAR collaboration (see https://www.perfsonar.net/about/mission-statement).   This collaboration  is focused on developing and deploying the =perfSONAR= software suite in support of network monitoring across the global set of research and education (R&E) networks.   The *Open Science Grid* (*OSG*) has chosen to base the core of its network monitoring framework on =perfSONAR= because of both the capabilities of the toolkit for measuring our networks and its global acceptance as the defacto network monitoring infrastructure of first choice.

From the https://www.perfsonar.net.about/what-is-perfsonar/ page we have a succinct summary of =perfSONAR=: _perfSONAR is a network measurement toolkit designed to provide federated coverage of paths, and help to establish end-to-end usage expectations.  There are 1000s of perfSONAR instances deployed world wide, many of which are available for open testing of key measures of network performance.  This global infrastructure helps to identify and isolate problems as they happen, making the role of supporting network users easier for engineering teams, and increasing productivity when utilizing network resources._

---+++ OSG Networking

*A challenge faced by OSG and its members and collaborators is how to understand, maintain and effectively utilize the networks that form the basis of our distributed collaborations?*

We have chosen to start by providing visibility into our networks by the deployment of =perfSONAR=.   This will allow us to regularly and consistently measure a set of network metrics that we can use to understand how are networks are operating.  When problems arise, the data, along with access to the =perfSONAR= tools, can be used to diagnose and localize problems.  The presence of perfSONAR toolkit deployments across our sites and networks makes identifying and fixing network problems feasible.

We strongly recommend that all OSG (and WLCG) sites deploy =perfSONAR= toolkit instances as described in our [[https://twiki.opensciencegrid.org/bin/view/Documentation/InstallUpdatePS][documentation elsewhere]].   This will not only benefit users of that site but will enable network engineers and OSG staff to much more effectively support those sites if network issues are suspected.

All OSG and WLCG sites should deploy *two* =perfSONAR= instances:  one to measure latency/packet loss and one to measure bandwidth.   It is possible to install both version on a single host with at least two NICs by following the instructions at http://docs.perfsonar.net/manage_dual_xface.html.    *NOTE:* It is *very important* that the perfSONAR instances be located in the same subnet as the primary storage for the site.   This is to ensure that we are measuring as much of the network path involved with data transfer as possible.
